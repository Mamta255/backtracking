    <h3>Common Layouts</h3>
    <p>Pure was crafted with the goal that it can be used in every web project. To showcase this, we've made some common layouts that leverage Pure. These layouts are responsive and don't require JavaScript (except for certain menu interactions).</p>
    <div>When viewing these layouts, view or copy the source to get a good understanding of what's happening. These layout examples are free to use in your own projects under the zLib license.</div>
